# ShuttleXpress-rs

An executable written in Rust that is supposed to be an alternative configuration software to the official ShuttleXpress software.
The current state is the first working prototype.
It can react to button presses and releases and will emit a Media Play/Pause keypress if the fifth (rightmost) button is pressed.

## Todo

  - [x] Read and update button state
  - [ ] Configurable actions
  - [ ] Run as systray
  - [ ] Multiple switchable configurations
  - [ ] Context-sensitive configuration switching
  - [ ] Multi-Platform
